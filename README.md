# Main-Scripts
Collection of R scripts applicable to multivariate data. Some will be useful for training and as templates.

The scripts included in this repository are taken from a range of projects which analyse metabolomic, transcriptomic and genomic data.
These cover UPLC-MS, GC-MS, NMR (NOESY, CPMG and JRES), copy number variant (CNV), RNA-seq and metagenomic data.

In most cases the data is formatted with variables in columns and samples in rows. These data are typicallt numeric and formatted as a data frame. 
Any complimentary metadata may be numeric, binary or character.

Importantly, R markdown (.rmd) scripts are written to be run directly using example datasets.
While .r scripts are specific to my data which are not disclosed or available at this time.


Happy coding!
